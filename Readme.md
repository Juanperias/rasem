# What's new?

In the first version of rasem the core library was not included, in this version of rasem the core library is included so you can do everything you need to create an os in rust.

# What is rasem?

Rasem is cross compiler for assembly and rust, with rasem you can program the bootloader in assembly and the kernel in rust, remember that the rust code is rust in no std and no main, besides you will use a target that compiles to x86 that is to 32 bits.

# How to install rasem

Installing rasem is a long story and I recommend you to go to the INSTALL.md which contains the steps (for arch linux)

# History of rasem

The truth is that I find the story of rasem interesting, it all starts because I wanted to make a bootloader, and I found it very difficult assembly because I did not dominate it and I said hey why not use C and asm, but I remembered that I am not an expert in C and only know the basics so I started the rasem project a cross compiler that has a boot loader in asm and a kernel in rust, and if you are reading this is because I managed to make rasem.
